# HYPERSKILL LECTURE NOTES

Some of the notes squeezed from Hyperskill lectures that I made during the short period of 2 months (free trial :v)

Language: Vietnamese (just being lazy of paraphrasing every sentences in English :( )

Mostly all the notes will be divided into 2 first main categories and others:

-   Mathematics

-   Python (including CS and ML)

-   And some notes can be Frontend, Scala or Java (or maybe there ain't any)
